The go-kit is a toolkit for building services in Go. It provides a set of packages and templates
that help in creating distributed systems, making it easier to implement core microservice functions such as request
handling, logging, monitoring, and more.

## Usage

```shell
#run linter
make lint

#build an application
make build

#test application into container
make test
```
